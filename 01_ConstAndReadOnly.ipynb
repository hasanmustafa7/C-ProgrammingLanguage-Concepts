    "\n",
    "The assignable value for read-only field can be run-time constant as well as compile-time constant.\n",
    "The value can be calculated at the run-time and be assigned to the read-only field inside the constructor.\n",

    "const can be applied to both variables and fields. \n",

    "However, const variables and fields, inside a class, must be assigned during the DECLARATION and can never be modified afterwards.\n",
